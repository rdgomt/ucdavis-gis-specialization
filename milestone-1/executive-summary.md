# Executive summary

The potential of natural and human resources and the fragility of the environment are premises that must be taken into account during the economic and environmental planning of a territory. In this sense, analytical studies on fragility, which can be expressed through maps and texts, are important documents.

Environmental fragility concerns the system's susceptibility to undergo interventions or to be changed. The magnitude of the instability depends on the tension applied to the system and the degree of susceptibility to change in the system itself.

This project aims to identify the degree of environmental fragility of the Tramanda√≠ River basin, located in the south of Brazil, through the classification of the system in different levels of vulnerability. It is hoped with this to recognize and map the areas most susceptible to instability, that is, those that due to their natural characteristics can easily be altered (either due to erosive processes, landslides, silting, floods, etc).
